Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.

You found an awesome customizable Python IDE that has almost everything you'd like to see in your working environment. However, after a couple days of coding you discover that there is one important feature that this IDE lacks: it cannot convert tabs to spaces. Luckily, the IDE is easily customizable, so you decide to write a plugin that would convert all tabs in the code into the given number of whitespace characters.

Implement a function that, given a piece of code and a positive integer x will turn each tabulation character in code into x whitespace characters.

Example

For code = "\treturn False" and x = 4, the output should be
convertTabs(code, x) = "    return False".
"""
def convertTabs(code, x):
    return code.replace("\t", " " * x)
