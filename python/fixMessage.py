Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.
One of your friends has an awful writing style: he almost never starts a message with a capital letter, but adds uppercase letters in random places throughout the message. It makes chatting with him very difficult for you, so you decided to write a plugin that will change each message received from your friend into a more readable form.

Implement a function that will change the very first symbol of the given message to uppercase, and make all the other letters lowercase.

Example

For message = "you'll NEVER believe what that 'FrIeNd' of mine did!!1",
the output should be
fixMessage(message) = "You'll never believe what that 'friend' of mine did!!1".
"""
def fixMessage(message):
    return upper()[0] + message[1:]. lower()
