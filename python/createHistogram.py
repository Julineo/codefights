Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.
You noticed that one of your employees has a weird performance rate: although his performance is usually good and stable, from time to time it drops drastically. You suspect it has something to do with the famous Code of Clones series: new episodes started to come out recently, and everyone watches and rewatches them every so often.

To confirm your theory, you'd like to create a histogram showing the number of assignments he completed each day in the given period. Given this assignments, return a list representing a horizontal histogram, where each bar is formed by the given character ch.

Example

For ch = '*' and assignments = [12, 12, 14, 3, 12, 15, 14],
the output should be

createHistogram(ch, assignments) = ["************",
                                    "************",
                                    "**************",
                                    "***",
                                    "************",
                                    "***************",
                                    "**************"]

def createHistogram(ch, assignments):
    return map(lambda x: x*ch, assignments)
