You found your old bike in the attic, and would love to refresh your childhood memories and give it a ride. Unfortunately there is a chain lock on the bike, and the code is a permutation of a set of distinct numbers. Of course, you don't remember it after all these years.

You do remember, however, that the last time you picked up your bike you also couldn't remember the code, so had to run over all possible numbers permutations. Being a programmer, you tried them in the lexicographical order. It took you a couple of days, and in the first day you managed to check k - 1 permutations.

Now that you need to open the lock again, you can start checking the permutations from the kth one. Given the list of numbers, return the kth (1-based) permutation that you should begin with.

Example

For numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 4, the output should be
kthPermutation(numbers, k) = [1, 2, 4, 5, 3].

Here are the first 4 permutations:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 5, 4]
[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]

    return list(permutations(numbers, len(numbers)))[k-1]
