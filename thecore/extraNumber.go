You're given three integers, a, b and c. It is guaranteed that two of these integers are equal to each other. What is the value of the third integer?

Example

For a = 2, b = 7, and c = 2, the output should be
extraNumber(a, b, c) = 7.

The two equal numbers are a and c. The third number (b) equals 7, which is the answer.

func extraNumber(a int, b int, c int) int {
    fmt.Println(1 ^ 5)
    return 0
}
