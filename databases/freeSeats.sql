You're working on the tech support team of an airline company, and your boss has asked you to implement a feature that shows the number of available seats on every flight.

Information about the airline is stored in three tables - flights, planes, and purchases, respectively. The tables are structured as follows:

flights:
flight_id: the unique flight id;
plane_id: the id of the plane making the flight.
planes:
plane_id: the unique plane id;
number_of_seats: the number of seats on the plane.
purchases:
flight_id: the flight id of the purchase;
seat_no: the seat number of the purchase.
It is guaranteed that in the purchases table, the pairs (flight_id, seat_no) are unique.

With the information provided in the database, you need to calculate the number of seats that are not yet purchased for each flight_id.

Given tables flights, planes, and purchases, build a table as follows: The resulting table should have columns flight_id and free_seats, where for each flight_id, free_seats is the number of seats that have not been purchased yet. The rows of the table should be ordered by flight_id in ascending order. It is guaranteed that the information in table purchases is consistent and there are no purchases for non-existing flight_ids or seat_nos.

Example

For the following tables flights

flight_id	plane_id
111		128
87		157
100		23
121		23

planes

plane_id	number_of_seats
128		5
23		7
157		4
239		2

and purchases

flight_id	seat_no
111		1
87		1
87		7
100		5

the output should be

flight_id	free_seats
87		2
100		6
111		4
121		7
Flight number 87 has 4 seats, and 2 of them have been purchased;
Flight number 100 has 7 seats, and one of them has been purchased;
Flight number 111 has 5 seats, and one of them has been purchased;
Flight number 121 has 7 seats, and none of them have been purchased.
