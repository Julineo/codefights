You own a small company, and you keep track of its income in the accounting table, which has the following structure:

date: a unique date on which your company was open;
profit: the amount of money your company earned that day;
loss: the amount of money your company lost that day.
You've decided to sell the company, and in order to make the offer more appealing to potential buyers you need to create a financial report.

Given the accounting table, compose the resulting table with three columns: year, quarter and net_profit. The first column should contain the year, the second one should contain the quarter of that year, and the third one should contain the net income (profit - loss difference) of your company during that period. The resulting table should be sorted by the year in ascending order. If there are several rows with the same year, sort them by the quarter in ascending order.

Don't include year/quarter in the answer if there is no entry for it in the accounting table.

Example

For the following table accounting

date	profit	loss
2006-01-01	100	15
2006-07-15	40	100
2006-08-01	50	50
2006-11-11	100	50
2006-12-01	50	80
2007-05-03	42	16
the output should be

year	quarter	net_profit
2006	1	85
2006	3	-60
2006	4	20
2007	2	26
